# Utils

A handful of useful, most of the time one-off, scripts.
Probably a mixture of Python and Bash.

-   [count](Count/count.py): A command-line tool to recursively count the number of files in a directory.
-   [uppercase](Uppercase/uppercase.py): A command-line tool to recursively capitalize all files in a directory. Use with CAUTION.
-   [Rewrite-History](Rewrite-history/rewrite.sh): A command-line tool to set commit dates to yesterday. Git is so beautiful, you can rewrite history.
-   [Argprase](Argparse/argparse.py): A sample of commonly used argparse options.
-   [Spinner](Spinner/spinner.py): A simple automatic spinner to show process activity with threading.
