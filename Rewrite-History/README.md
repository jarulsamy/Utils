# Rewrite-History

A simple CLI tool to change the days git commits occur. Don't ask why I needed this :smile:.

`rewrite.sh` is a simpler version that shouldn't really be used anymore.

## Usage

Run with:

```
$ ./rewrite.py
```

View the builtin help with:
```
$ ./rewrite.py -h

usage: rewrite.py [-h] [-t TIMESTAMP]

optional arguments:
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
  -t TIMESTAMP, --timestamp TIMESTAMP
                        An optional custom timestamp.
```
